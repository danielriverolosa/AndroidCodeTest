This is an INNOCV code test to check the ability of candidates, the intention is to know the fluidity and knowledge they have with common and basic tasks that must be well established as architecture, design patterns and unit tests.

The candidate must complete the test in approximately one hour, must apply the knowledge he has, along with the technologies already used by the project. It is not necessary to use more libraries than those already used in the project.

The project is a basic CRUD of users, where the candidate must complete the deletion of users, for this the following points will be taken into account:

1. **Clean Code**
2. **Readability**
3. **Good architecture control**
3. **Good project handling**
4. **Testing**

It is not necessary to finish all the code test, it is a way of knowing how the candidate develops in a project already created and that he does not know.

**Remember:** Always look for the simplest solution and then try to improve what you need, everything can be improved, but it is better that it works.

Good luck!
